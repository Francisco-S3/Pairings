### Basic set up and work flow:
1) Clone repository to your local machine
2) Create a new branch and call it &lt;your name&gt;
3) While on your new branch, work on your code
4) Stage changes
5) Commit changes
6) Push branch to github repository
7) Create a pull request to merge you changes

### Commands to get you started
(INSTALL GIT ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE BEFORE DOING THIS)
1) from the command line, navigate to the directory you wish to clone into (I just use the Desktop)
2) run `git clone https://github.com/Francisco-S3/Pairings.git` to clone the repository
3) run `cd Pairings` to go into the repo you just cloned
4) run `git checkout -b <your name>` to create a branch called &lt;your name&gt; (you're automaticly on your new branch after you do this)
5) add your name to the readme file and save it
6) run `git add .` to stage your changes
7) run `git commit -m"added name to readme"` to commit changes
8) run `git push -u origin <your name>` to push your branch to github
9) go to the repo on github and click "compare and pull request"

### Additions to support files
1)  need to create a folder named 'assets' and add all image files
2)  need to create a folder name 'fonts' and add all .ttf files from fonts.google.com
3)  need to update 'pubspec.yaml' file with links to these storage locations

### Application environment setup for your IDE
1)  add Dio package to pubspec.yaml file by running '$ flutter pub add dio'
2)  command from root directory of your application
3)  add Intl package to pubspec.yaml file by running 'S flutter pub add intl'
4)  command from root directory of your application
